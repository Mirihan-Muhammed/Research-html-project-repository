<h3><font color = "#ff9999">Mobile Development</h3>
<p><font color = "#000000"><p style="font-size:20px">Making mobile applications is a little bit tricky, as there is more than one operating systems for mobiles and the different operating system requires different languages for these applications. An operating system means that the piece of software on your device which is responsible of dealing with the hardware of this device, it is the layer that sits between the application you create and the hardware, whether it is a mic or a touchscreen or GPS. The most two common operating systems are Android and IOS. Android is most commonly used in Samsung while IOS is used in Apple. To create Android apps, you would need either Java or Kotlin, and for creating IOS applications you would need Objective-C or Swift. Recently, it became possible to create mobile applications for both Android and IOS using Javascript or Dart.

<h3><font color="#ff6666">Game Development</h3>
<p><font color = "#000000"><p style="font-size:20px">Game development is one of the most interesting track, many developers enjoy it and there are developers who develop games just for the fun. Making games requires what is called a game engine, which is a software that is used as the infrastructure for building the game and defines what the game has and what it can do. If you are familiar with Epic Games and Fortnight, Epic Games is, in fact, a game engine and Fortnight is built upon it. The languages used in game development are mostly C++, C# since it requires a lot of memory optimization and fast performance to create rich graphics. It is not limited to C++ and C#, however, and it kind of is about which engine you are using and which platform you are targeting, Lua and Java are also very famous candidates in this industry.

<h3><font color="#ff1a1a">Web Development</h3>

<p><font color = "#000000"><p style="font-size:20px">There is front-end development, which is the part of web development that makes the application that runs on your browser and it also adjusts the styling, the colors, the interactions. It is fundamentlly concerned with what the user of a website sees. You are reading this blog on some screen which is shown to you by front-end code. Front-end basics start with HTML and CSS with use of JavaScript. Javascript has become one of the most dominant languages in the last few years for front-end work.
